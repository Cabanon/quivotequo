A9-0184/2023-38,NULL,"(28c) The way a company can be involved in an adverse impact varies. A company can cause an adverse impact where its activities on their own are sufficient to result in an adverse impact. A company can contribute to an adverse impact where its own activities, in combination with the activities of other entities, cause an impact, or that the activities of the company cause, facilitate or incentivise another entity to cause an adverse impact. The contribution must be substantial, meaning that it does not include minor or trivial contributions. Assessing the substantial nature of the contribution and understanding when the actions of the company may have caused, facilitated or incentivised another entity to cause an adverse impact can involve the consideration of multiple factors. Several factors can be taken into account, including the extent to which a company may encourage or motivate an adverse impact by another entity, i.e. the degree to which the activity increased the risk of the impact occurring, the extent to which a company could or should have known about the adverse impact or potential for adverse impact, i.e. the degree of foreseeability, and the degree to which any of the company's activities actually mitigated the adverse impact or decreased the risk of the impact occurring. The mere existence of a business relationship or activities which create the general conditions in which it is possible for adverse impacts to occur should not in itself constitute a relationship of contribution. The activity in question should substantially increase the risk of adverse impact. Lastly, a company can be directly linked to an impact, where there is a relationship between the adverse impact and the company’s products, services or operations through another business relationship and where the company has neither caused nor contributed to the impact. Directly linked is not defined by a direct business relationship. Also, a direct linkage should not imply that the responsibility shifts from the business relationship causing an adverse impact to the company with which it has a linkage.",2022/0051(COD)

However, the prohibition set in the delegated acts should apply to specific product groups to be determined based on an assessment by the Commission of the extent to which the destruction of such products takes place in practice, taking into account the information made available by economic operators where appropriate. To ensure that this obligation is proportionate, the Commission should consider specific exemptions under which destroying unsold consumer products may still be permitted, for instance in view of health and safety concerns. To monitor the effectiveness of this prohibition and to dis-incentivise circumvention, economic operators should be required to disclose the number of unsold consumer products destroyed and the reasons for their destruction under applicable exemptions. Finally, to avoid any undue administrative burden on SMEs, they should be exempted from the obligations to disclose their unsold discarded products and from the prohibition to discard specific products groups set in delegated acts.

A system of extended producer responsibility is the most appropriate means to achieve this, as it would limit the financial impact on the taxpayer and water tariff, while providing an incentive to develop greener products. To limit unintended consequences on the availability, affordability and accessibility of vital products, the producer responsibility should be complemented by national funding, due to the high societal value of the sectors covered by the extended producer responsibility. Extended producer responsibility schemes should be implemented in line with the deadline provided in the transposition provisions of this Directive. Pursuant to Article 191 TFEU, Union policy on the environment is to aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union. It is to be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay. The polluter pays principle refers to a principle according to which polluters should bear the costs of their pollution or environmental damage, including the cost of measures taken to prevent, control and remedy the pollution. The extended producer responsibility scheme provided for in this Directive is based upon the polluter pays principle and is aimed at the full implementation combined with a national contribution due to the need for further examination to ensure complete responsibility for all the pollution caused and full funding not to undermine the availability and accessibility of vital products. Pharmaceuticals and cosmetic residues currently represent the main sources of micro-pollutants found in urban wastewater requiring an additional treatment (quaternary treatment). Therefore, extended producer responsibility should apply to those two product groups. Due to national variations, Member States should be given flexibility enough to designate which products are classified as vital products, which could be, for example, medicines with a high impact on life quality, hygienic products or sun protection products.

A9-0319/2023-474,NULL,"  Table 2a: Indicative parameters to be considered when establishing design criteria for recycling under Article 6    D cre its ei rg in a for recycling                                                 Description     Additives                           The presence of additives in the packaging containers can lead to                                       incorrect sorting of the packaging materials during the sorting                                       process and contaminate the resulting secondary raw materials.                                        Different types of plastic have a different density, which is used for                                       the separation of materials in the sorting technology. If this specific                                       density of a plastic type is artificially changed by adding density                                       modifying materials (i.e. additives), the sorting process can no                                       longer be used. A decisive limit is the density above or below 1                                       g/cm3.   Labels/sleeves                      Full sleeves or sleeves in a package can lead to incorrect sorting                                       during the sorting process and can degrade the quality of the                                       secondary raw materials.                                        For bottles, if the material of the sleeve is not identical to that of the                                       bottle and/or the sleeve is printed all over, the colour of the bottle                                       (e.g. transparent) cannot be assigned and sorted correctly.   Closure systems and                 Closures that are not firmly attached to the packaging can increase   small parts                         littering and also reduce the efficiency of the sorting and subsequent                                       recycling processes. Small parts can be attached mechanically to                                       enable easy removal in the sorting process.                                        Plastic closures should be designed in such a way that they can be                                       separated before disposal or during the sorting process. In PET                                       bottles, if sealing foils are used, they must be easy to remove without                                       leaving any residue                                       Closures of PET bottles shall ideally have a density less than 1                                       g/cm3 to allow separation during the sorting or recycling process.                                        From 2024 onwards, the adhesion of the closure (according to                                       Article 6 of Directive 2019/904) must be guaranteed for the time of                                       intended use for beverage containers of up to 3 litres.   Adhesives                          Adhesive components should be designed in such a way that they                                       can be easily separated in the recycling process or by the end user                                      (OR do not affect the efficiency of the sorting and recycling                                      processes). The presence of adhesive residues on the packaging can                                      downgrade the quality (purity) of the secondary raw materials.                                      Adhesive materials containing metal or aluminium (with a layer                                      thickness of > 5 µm) can lead to unwanted sorting into the metal                                      fraction.                                       Adhesives should be water washable to ensure separation from the                                      main packaging and that no adhesive residue would remain.   Colours                            Heavily dyed materials in paper or plastics can cause problems with                                       regard to sorting and can downgrade the quality of secondary raw                                      materials.                                      For instance, carbon black-based dyes, can, in the context of                                      infrared sorting detection during the plastics sorting process, lead to                                      incorrect classification of the material, or the material being                                      eliminated in the sorting process. However, there are already black                                      and dark dyes available that can be detected with infrared and are                                      not carbon-black based.    Material                           Use of mono-materials or material combinations that permit easy   composition                        separation and ensure high yield of secondary raw materials is                                      preferable.   Barriers/coatings                  The presence of barriers/coatings within the packaging can make                                      recycling more difficult. However, if barrier requirements exist,                                      materials such as silicon oxide or aluminium oxide can be used up to                                      a certain percentage.                                       For paper/carton packaging, coating should be avoided in principle.                                      However, single-sided plastic coatings or plastic laminate can be                                      used so to ensure fibre content in the best case higher than 95%.    Inks/printing                      The use of inks with substances of concern hinders recycling, as                                      those packaging units cannot be recycled. Printing inks when                                      released can contaminate the recycling stream through the washing                                      water. Likewise, printing inks, which are not released can impair the                                      transparency of the recycling stream.    Product                            The design of the packaging should enable the easy emptying of its   residues/ease of                   content and when disposed of should be in a fully drained condition.   emptying                           In fact, residues in the packaging can have negative effects on                                      recycling fractions.    Ease of dismantling                Design approaches can facilitate the ease of dismantling of   (design  feature of                packaging products into different parts, e.g. in parts that are rich in   the packaging)                     valuable materials and/or hazardous substances. This helps to                                      extract the target material from the packaging and thus increase the                                      recyclability potential of the packaging.",2022/0396(COD)

The pathway should take particular heed of SMEs in the automotive supply chain, of the consultation of social partners including by Member States, and also build on the European Skills Agenda with initiatives like the Pact for Skills to mobilise the private sector and other stakeholders to up-skill and re-skill Europe’s workforce in view of the green and digital transitions. The appropriate actions and incentives at European and national level to boost the affordability of zero emission vehicles should also be addressed in the pathway.

In this context, a transition pathway should be developed for the mobility ecosystem to accompany the transition of the automotive value chain, in full transparency and in consultation with all stakeholders, including by considering the establishment of a specific forum for social dialogue in the automotive sector. The pathway should take particular heed of SMEs, including micro-enterprises, in the automotive supply chain, of the consultation of social partners including by Member States, and also build on the Council recommendation on ensuring a fair transition towards climate neutrality and on the European Skills Agenda with initiatives like the Pact for Skills to mobilise the private sector and other stakeholders to up-skill and re-skill Europe’s workforce in view of the green and digital transitions. The appropriate actions and incentives at European and national level to boost the affordability and sustainability of zero emission vehicles should also be addressed in the pathway. The role that public procurement can play in the pathway should also be addressed, and in that regard the Commission should consider a revision of Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council26a to ensure its alignment with the objectives of Regulation 2019/631. The progress made on this comprehensive transition pathway for the mobility ecosystem should be monitored every year as part of a progress report to be submitted by the Commission, looking inter alia at the progress in the deployment of zero-emission vehicles, their price developments and their energy consumption, impacts on consumers, deployment of alternative fuels development and infrastructure roll-out as required under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation, development of the share of renewable energy as required under the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council26b, the potential of innovative technologies to reach climate neutral mobility, international competitiveness, investments in the automotive value chain, up-skilling and re-skilling of workers and reconversion of activities especially in regions with a high percentage of jobs related to the automotive value chain, and emissions linked to the age of light-duty vehicles while considering actions aimed at a synchronous, socially-just and environmentally sound phase-out of older vehicles . The progress report will also build on the progress reports that Member States submit under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation. The Commission should consult social partners in the preparation of the progress report, including the results in the social dialogue. The Commission should also consult with a wide range of independent experts, stakeholders and national and regional administrations in order to ensure a comprehensive knowledge base. Innovations in the automotive supply chain are continuing. Innovative technologies such as the production of electro-fuels with air capture and hydrogen cars with onboard hydrogen storage system technology, if further developed, could offer prospects for affordable climate neutral mobility. The Commission should therefore keep track of progress in the state of innovation in the sector as part of its progress report.  _________________ 26 Commission Communication - Updating the 2020 New Industrial Strategy: Building a stronger Single Market for Europe’s recovery, COM(2021) 350 final of 5 May 2021  26a Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 amending Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles (OJ L 188, 12.7.2019, p. 116). 26b Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (OJ L 328 21.12.2018, p. 82).",2021/0197(COD)

A collective commitment aiming to achieve climate-neutrality in the land sector in 2035 at EU level can provide the needed planning certainty to drive land-based mitigation action in the short term, considering that it can take many years for such action to deliver the desired mitigation outcomes. Moreover, the land sector is projected to become the largest sector in the EU greenhouse gas flux profile in 2050. It is therefore particularly important to anchor that sector to a trajectory that can effectively deliver net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

On the basis of these plans, the Commission should propose national targets, ensuring that the Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the land use, land use change and forestry sector and the emissions from the agriculture non- CO2 sectors are at least balanced by 2035.

The sectors within the land pillar are expected to contribute differently to the climate neutrality goal. In particular, cropland, grassland and wetlands are currently net emitters of greenhouse gases in the Union, but have the potential to become a source of net removals of greenhouse gases, in particular through the upscaling of agroforestry, organic farming, and the restoration of wetlands and peatlands.

Such incentives and business models will enhance climate mitigation in the bio-economy, including through the use of durable harvested wood products, in full respect of ecological principles fostering biodiversity and the circular economy. Hence, new categories of carbon storage products should be introduced in addition to the harvested wood products.

Sustainably sourced long-lived harvested wood and bio-based carbon storage products can contribute to the circular bioeconomy by acting as substitutes for fossil-based options, but the potential for carbon storage in those products is determined by the lifespan of those products. The benefit of using wood to replace competing energies or materials with higher carbon footprints is also dependent on harvesting methods, transport and processing. Hence, new categories of carbon storage products may be introduced only if they are long-lived, have a net-positive carbon sequestration effect based on a life-cycle assessment, including the impact on land use and land use change associated with increased harvesting, and provided that the available data are science-based, transparent and verifiable.

A9-0161/2022-89,"(10) In order to enhance greenhouse gas removals, individual farmers or forest managers need a direct incentive to store more carbon on their land and their forests. New business models based on carbon farming incentives and on the certification of carbon removals need to be increasingly deployed in the period until 2030. Such incentives and business models will enhance climate mitigation in the bio-economy, including through the use of durable harvested wood products, in full respect of ecological principles fostering biodiversity and the circular economy. Hence, new categories of carbon storage products should be introduced in addition to the harvested wood products. The emerging business models, farming and land management practices to enhance removals contribute to a balanced territorial development and economic growth in rural areas. They also create opportunities for new jobs and provide incentives for relevant training, reskilling and upskilling.","(10) In order to enhance greenhouse gas removals, individual farmers, land and forest owners or forest managers should be encouraged to store more carbon on their land and their forests. Such incentives should also enhance climate mitigation and overall emission reduction across sectors in the bio-economy, including through the use of durable harvested wood products, in full respect of ecological principles fostering biodiversity and the circular economy. Sustainably sourced long-lived harvested wood and bio-based carbon storage products can contribute to the circular bio-economy by acting as substitutes for fossil-based options, but the potential for carbon storage in those products is determined by the lifespan of those products. The benefit of using wood to replace competing energies or materials with higher carbon footprints is also dependent on harvesting methods, transport and processing.

To avoid any distortions on the air services market, all Union airports covered by this Regulation should be supplied with uniform minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuels. Whereas the market is free to supply and use larger quantities of sustainable fuel, this Regulation should ensure that the mandatory minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuels are the same across all the covered airports. It supersedes any requirements established directly or indirectly at national or regional level requiring aircraft operators or aviation fuel suppliers to uptake or supply sustainable aviation fuels with different targets than the ones prescribed under this Regulation.

When produced from renewable electricity and carbon captured directly from the air, synthetic aviation fuels can achieve as high as 100% emissions savings compared to conventional aviation fuel. They also have notable advantages compared to other types of sustainable aviation fuels with regards to resource efficiency (in particular for water needs) of the production process. However, synthetic aviation fuels’ production costs are currently estimated at 3 to 6 times higher than the market price of conventional aviation fuel. Therefore, this Regulation should establish a dedicated sub-obligation for this technology.

Whereas the market is free to supply and use larger quantities of sustainable fuel, this Regulation should ensure that the mandatory minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuels are the same across all the covered airports. The availability of feedstock and the production capacity of sustainable aviation fuel are not unlimited. A situation in which some Member States would adopt higher overall sustainable aviation fuel supply obligations at national level will intensify the competition for feedstock with other transport and energy sectors and could lead to shortages of supply in other regions. This would undermine the ability of aircraft operators in these regions to decarbonise, and unfairly increase the cost to those aircraft operators of compliance notably with the EU ETS, leading to market distortions and an overall competitive disadvantage. Therefore, common EU-level target setting for the overall production and for the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels should be set. This Regulation supersedes any requirements established directly or indirectly at national or regional level requiring aircraft operators or aviation fuel suppliers to uptake or supply sustainable aviation fuels with different targets than the ones prescribed under this Regulation.
